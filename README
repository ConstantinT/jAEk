jÄk

jÄk is a web vulnerability crawler and scanner that I developed during my master thesis.
It aim is it to crawl web applications heavily build with JavaScript.

To implement this, we used JavaScript function hooking to find all events attached with the addEventListener
function. In addition this technique allows jÄk to recognize the execution of other interessting function. 
Moreover we implement methods to analyze staticaly all HTML elements
within the tree to find static events.

For using it you need:
 - Python3
 - PYQT5 (Version 5.3 - 5.4)
 - mongodb 
 - pymongo bindings < 3.x.x.

Acutally you cannot start it with the command line. To start it copy and overwrite the main.py file and start this.
There you find comments on how to use it. In the example.py you find the configuration I used for my 
thesis and the paper. If you find bugs just use the issue tool from github and please provide 
me the last 50 lines of output and the software you tested. I will fix them as soon as possible.

Enjoy using it and good luck ;)
