JÄk allows you to crawl Web applications build with JavaScript. 

For using it you need a current version of Python3, PYQT5, mongodb and the pymongo bindings < 3.x.x.

The start file of JÄk is the main.py(will later changed). There you find comments on how to use it.
If you find bugs just use the issue tool from github and please provide me the last 50 lines of output. If this is 
not possible send me a mail at constantin.tschuertz@gmail.com with the same informations ;)
I will fix them as soon as possible.

Enjoy using it and good luck ;)
