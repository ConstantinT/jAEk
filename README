This is jÄk, I developed during my master thesis.

JÄk allows you to crawl Web applications build with JavaScript.

For using it you need a current version of Python3, PYQT5, mongodb and the pymongo bindings < 3.x.x.

The start file of JÄk is the main.py. There you find comments on how to use it. In the example.py you find the
configuration I used for my thesis and the paper.
If you find bugs just use the issue tool from github and please provide me the last 50 lines of output.
I will fix them as soon as possible.

Enjoy using it and good luck ;)
